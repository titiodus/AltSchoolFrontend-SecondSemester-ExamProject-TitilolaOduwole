# A REACT PROJECT by Titilola Oduwole
## ALTSCHOOL FRONTEND SECOND SEMESTER EXAM November 2022

I implemented an API fetch of my GitHub portfolio

I showed a page with a list of all my repositories on GitHub(the page implemented pagination for the repo list)

I created another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes while using a custom Hook, useState and UseEffect. 

I implement proper SEO, Error Boundary (I created a page to test the error boundary) and 404 pages. 

Good UI and Designs, if I may say so myself. 

This project is hosted on vercel [GithubProject](https://alt-school-frontend-second-semester-exam-project-m3shijy8c.vercel.app/)




### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
